# LITA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
The final project of the LITA Data Analysis Training

## CAPSTONE PROJECT
The project consist of two activities:

###  Project 1: 
Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store: In this project, I am  tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store.  I explored  sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional  performance, and monthly sales trends.
The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI  dashboard that highlights these findings.

### Project 2: 
Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service: This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify  segments and trends. The goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types,  and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. 
The final deliverable is a Power BI  dashboard that presents your analysis.
