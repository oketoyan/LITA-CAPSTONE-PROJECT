# LITA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
“What message is this? What is LITA?” this was my thought when I open the url link to join the moving train of Ladies in Tech Africa in celebration of Mummy FOlu Adeboye. I have always wanted Data Analysis so it was not a big deal in choosing my options not knowing I have a whole lot waiting for me.
Days has passes, weeks and even months and The Incubator Hub has really helped me in becoming a better version of myself. As part of the requirements to further in this awesome training, a project titled ‘LITA CAPSTONE’ has been given to everyone of us to practice and showcase what we have learnt so far.
LITA CAPSTONE projects has two datasets – SalesData and CustomerData, it is required that you use the three tools learnt in the training session- MSExcel, SQL and PowerBI, to get tangible deductions and recommendations from the data sets. After which you populate it on the github and submit. There is always a room for continuous learning, corrections, growing and getting better. I think I have put in some efforts in getting my project ready if not the best I could do, I participated in my own quota.

###  Project 1: Sales Data
Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store: In this project, I am  tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store.  I explored  sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional  performance, and monthly sales trends.
The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI  dashboard that highlights these findings.

The SalesData file consist of 7 columns (OrderID	, CustomerId, Product,Region,  OrderDate, Quantity, Unit Price)	 having 1,000 rows. To get some details I generated extra 2 columns (Revenue and Sales Category). 
From the dataset, 6 products are on sale (Gloves, Hat, Jacket, Shirt, Shoes and Socks) and all these products are doing well in all regions based on the analysis shown below In MSExcel and SQL:

![Product by TotalRevenue](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42e73d82-a393-440f-b709-bd620f7d4398)

From the analysis done it was observed that by region , Southern Part has the Highest revenue and the Western Part has the lowest revenue as shown below:

### Recommendations:
I recommend that the company:
1.	Do a discount sales to appreciate the customers who has continually patronize the company,
2.	look into adding more products for children if all their products focused mainly on adults
3.	look into adding more of female wears too as they are into wears clearly



### Project 2: Customer Data
Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service: This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify  segments and trends. The goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types,  and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. 
The final deliverable is a Power BI  dashboard that presents your analysis. 

The CustomerData file consist of 8 columns (CustomerID, CustomerName, Region, SubscriptionType, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd, Canceled and Revenue) having 1,000 rows. To get some details I generated extra 3 columns (showing the date extraction in years, months and date)
Premium, Basic and Standard are the three subscription type offered to the customers which all last through a year in all regions.  
Analysis revealed that Basic subscription generates more revenue than others as it has more customers as shown below:

![totalrevenueby subscription type sql](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5be19d9-ee0e-4bf1-8bab-36b2702c3a6d)

Analysis also revealed that Basic subscription type has customers in only the North and East region which makes it has more revenue than the Premium and Standard which only used in the South and West respectively.

### Recommendations: 
1.	The company should look into promoting the benefits of the different subscription types in all the regions.
2.	A promo should be done to make the customers see and use the other subscription types to avoid monopoly of subscription types in regions.
3.	A discount should be given at the end of each year to customers to appreciate and encourage to subscribe early and continuously.


## Conclusion
Finally, on my Power BI dashboard, I displayed some of the results generated from both MSExcel and SQL. I came to realize that all these tools are good and unique in their own way. I look forward to learning more and analyzing more dataset if I am given the opportunity by LITA.
